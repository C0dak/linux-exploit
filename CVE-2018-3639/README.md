# Exploit CVE-2018-3639 with Linux kernel eBPF

- as knows as. Speculative store bypass, Spectre Variant4 [1]

- It's to read privileged kernel memory from unprivileged user. (non-root user)

- It exploits CVE-2018-3639 and eBPF in Linux kernel.

- Tested on 4.4.0-128-generic #154-Ubuntu kernel. (Ubuntu 16.04), CPU - Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6700 CPU @ 3.40GHz

- Tested environment includes mitigations against Spectre, Meltdown, and SMEP, SMAP are applied. 

- First exploit code against CVE-2018-3639 is from Google project zero team. [2]
  But, the exploit requires additional assumptions such as kernel modification, ...
  So, testing the exploit is not easy.

- I updated the exploit code aginst CVE-2018-3639 to remove additional assumptions.
  and It perfectly works on specific Ubuntu kernel.
  But, Since this exploit is based on a probabilistic way, It's semi-reliable.

- Attack strategy and usage are included in exploit code. (poc_non_root.c)
